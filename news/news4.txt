‘Hey, fascist! Catch!’ says bullet casing found in Kirk shooting — governor

NEW YORK, September 12. /TASS/. Shell casings from the rifle that was allegedly used to murder right-wing activist Charlie Kirk were engraved with various inscriptions, one of which read "Hey, fascist! Catch!"

Utah Governor Spencer Cox confirmed that the rifle cartridges contained anti-fascist and LGBT (recognized as extremist and prohibited in Russia) engravings, including the phrase "Hey, fascist! Catch!", while others contained lyrics from the Italian anti-fascist song Bella Ciao.

Kirk, 31, was shot and killed on Wednesday during his speech at the university in Orem, Utah. The conservative activist was a supporter of President Donald Trump and, according to the Associated Press, contributed significantly to his victory in the last presidential election. Kirk has repeatedly opposed American military aid to Ukraine.

The suspect in the murder, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was detained on the evening of September 11. He was handed over to the authorities by his father, who said his son confessed to him what he did. Trump stated he hopes Robinson is convicted and sentenced to death.
